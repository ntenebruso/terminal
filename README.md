# Terminal Portfolio

A web-based TUI simulation of my portfolio website.

## Overview

-   This web app was made as a fun proof-of-concept to see how to implement an extensible terminal API in TypeScript.
-   Feel free to fork this for your own portfolio/project, or use the terminal library (which I plan to separate at some point)

## Built With

This project utilizes an extensible Terminal emulator library built in TypeScript, with support for command arguments and basic user input. Read more about this in my [blog post](https://ntenebruso.com/posts/terminal-portfolio/), which will be updated soon as I recently refactored this project.
